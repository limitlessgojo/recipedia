               <p>
                  Ingredients:
               <ul>
                  <li>4 cups (500g) bread flour</li>
                  <li>1 tablespoon sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, 1 tablespoon active dry yeast, 1 1/4 cups (300ml) warm water</li>
               </ul>
               </p>
               <p>
                  Assembly:
                  <br>
                  <br>Start by combining the bread flour, sugar, salt, and active dry yeast in a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the center and pour in the warm water. Use a wooden spoon or your hands to mix the ingredients until a dough forms.
                  <br>
                  <br>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Shape the dough into a ball and place it in a lightly greased bowl, covering it with a clean kitchen towel. Let the dough
                  rise in a warm, draft-free place for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
                  <br>
                  <br>Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Divide the dough into equal portions, depending on the size of bagels you want to make. Shape each portion into a ball, then use your thumb to poke a hole through
                  the center. Stretch the hole slightly to form a ring shape.
                  <br>
                  <br>Place the shaped bagels on a parchment-lined baking sheet, cover them with a clean kitchen towel, and let them rise for another 20-30 minutes.
                  <br>
                  <br>While the bagels are rising, preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Bring a large pot of water to a boil and carefully drop the bagels in, a few at a time. Boil them for about 1-2 minutes on each side, then remove them with a slotted
                  spoon and place them back on the baking sheet.

         <div class="recipe-content">
            <p>
               Ingredients:
            <ul>
               <li>4 cups (500g) all-purpose flour, 1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar</li>
               <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
               <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast, 1 cup (240ml) warm milk, 1/4 cup (60g) unsalted butter, melted, 2 large eggs</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
               Assembly:
               <br>
               <br>To make the dough for the cinnamon rolls, start by combining the all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, salt, and active dry yeast in a large mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, mix together the warm milk, melted butter, and eggs. Pour the
               wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until a dough forms.Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean
               kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place for about 1-1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about 1/4 inch thick.
               <br>
               <br>For the cinnamon filling, mix together 1/2 cup (100g) brown sugar and 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon. Spread a generous layer of softened butter over the rolled-out dough, then sprinkle the cinnamon sugar mixture evenly over the butter.
               <br>
               <br>Starting from one long edge, tightly roll the dough into a log. Use a sharp knife to slice the log into 12 equal-sized pieces.
               <br>
               <br>Place the sliced cinnamon rolls in a greased baking dish, leaving a little space between each roll. Cover the dish with a clean kitchen towel and let the rolls rise for another 30-45 minutes.
               <br>
               <br>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Once the rolls have risen, bake them in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through.
               <br>
               <br>While the rolls are baking, prepare the cream cheese frosting. Mix together 4 ounces (113g) softened cream cheese, 1/4 cup (60g) softened unsalted butter, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and 1 cup (120g) powdered sugar until smooth and creamy.
               <br>
               <br>Once the cinnamon rolls are done baking, let them cool slightly before spreading the cream cheese frosting over the top. Serve the warm cinnamon rolls and enjoy the deliciously sweet and gooey treat!

Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden brown. Be careful not to overbake, as you want the cookies to be soft and chewy.<br><br>Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.
