                <li>1 cup plain yogurt,
                    2 tablespoons lemon juice,
                    2 teaspoons ground cumin,

Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickened.<br><br>Pour in the heavy cream and stir until well combined. Simmer for another 5 minutes to heat through.Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed, adding more salt or spices if desired.

      <div class="recipe-content">
        <p>
            Ingredients:
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon sugar,
                    1/2 teaspoon salt,
                    1 teaspoon baking powder,
                    2 tablespoons plain yogurt,
                    2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (120ml) warm milk</li>
            </ul>

Roll out each dough ball into a round or oval shape, about 1/4 inch thick.<br><br>Carefully place the rolled-out dough onto the hot skillet or griddle. Cook for about 1-2 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and puffy, pressing down gently with a spatula to ensure even cooking.<br><br>Remove the cooked naan from the skillet and brush it with melted butter while it's still hot.Repeat the process with the remaining dough portions until all the naan are cooked.
