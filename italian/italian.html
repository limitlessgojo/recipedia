            <div class="recipe-content">
                <p>Ingredients:
                <ul>
                    <li>500g (about 4 cups) of high-protein pizza flour (tipo "00" or bread flour)</li>
                    <li>325ml (about 1 1/3 cups) of lukewarm water</li>
                    <li>7g (about 2 1/4 tsp) of active dry yeast</li>
                    <li>1 tsp of sugar</li>
                    <li>2 tsp of salt</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p> For the Toppings:
                <ul>
                    <li>400g (about 14 oz) of canned San Marzano tomatoes or passata</li>
                    <li>Fresh mozzarella cheese, torn into pieces</li>
                    <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
                    <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
                    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                    <li>Optional: Other toppings like pepperoni, mushrooms, olives, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Assembly: start by making the dough. In a large bowl, dissolve 1 teaspoon of sugar in 325ml of
                    lukewarm water and sprinkle 7g of active dry yeast over it. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy.
                    In another bowl, mix 500g of high-protein pizza flour and 2 teaspoons of salt. Gradually add the
                    flour mixture to the yeast mixture until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for
                    8-10 minutes until smooth. Place it in a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let it rise in a warm place
                    for 1-2 hours.
                </p>
                <p> For the toppings, crush canned San Marzano tomatoes and season with salt and pepper. Tear fresh
                    mozzarella cheese and pick basil leaves.Once the dough has risen, divide it into portions and
                    flatten each into a round disc on a floured surface. Spread the tomato sauce over the dough, leaving
                    a border around the edges. Add the torn mozzarella evenly over the sauce. Drizzle with extra virgin
                    olive oil and season with salt and pepper.Preheat your oven to 500°F (260°C) with a pizza stone
                    inside. Transfer the assembled pizza onto the hot pizza stone and bake for 8-12 minutes until the
                    crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly. Once out of the oven, scatter fresh basil leaves
                    over the hot pizza. Slice and serve immediately.

            <div class="recipe-title">Tiramisu</div>
            <div class="recipe-content">
                <p>Ingredients:
                <ul>
                    <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
                    <li>150g granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>250g mascarpone cheese</li>
                    <li>300ml heavy cream</li>
                    <li>200ml strong brewed espresso, cooled</li>
                    <li>200g ladyfinger biscuits (savoiardi)</li>
                    <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder, for dusting</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p> Begin by separating the egg yolks from the whites. In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the
                    granulated sugar until pale and thickened. Add the mascarpone cheese to the egg yolk mixture and
                    whisk until smooth and well combined. In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks
                    form. Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture until fully incorporated. <br>
                    <br>In a shallow dish, combine the cooled espresso with the coffee liqueur. Dip each ladyfinger
                    biscuit into the espresso mixture briefly, ensuring it is soaked but not overly saturated. Arrange a
                    layer of soaked ladyfinger biscuits in the bottom of a serving dish or baking dish. <br> <br>Spread
                    half of the mascarpone mixture over the layer of ladyfingers, smoothing it out evenly with a
                    spatula. Repeat with another layer of soaked ladyfinger biscuits and the remaining mascarpone
                    mixture. <br> <br>Cover the tiramisu with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or
                    preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to meld and the dessert to set. <br> <br>Before serving,
                    dust the top of the tiramisu with unsweetened cocoa powder using a fine-mesh sieve. Slice and serve
                    chilled, enjoying the creamy layers of mascarpone and espresso-soaked ladyfingers in this classic
                    Italian dessert. Buon appetito!

            <div class="recipe-content">
                <p>Ingredients:
                <ul>
                    <li>Pasta of your choice (such as spaghetti, fettuccine, or penne)</li>
                    <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>

                    <li>Grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p> Assembly: <br> Begin by cooking the pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water according to the
                    package instructions until al dente. While the pasta is cooking, heat a generous amount of extra
                    virgin olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add minced garlic to the skillet and sauté until
                    fragrant and lightly golden. If desired, sprinkle in some crushed red pepper flakes for a hint of
                    spice. Once the pasta is cooked, drain it well and add it to the skillet with the garlic-infused
                    olive oil. Toss the pasta gently to coat it evenly with the oil and garlic. Tear fresh basil leaves
                    and add them to the pasta, stirring to incorporate. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.
                    Serve the pasta hot, topped with grated Parmesan cheese for a burst of flavor. This simple yet
                    delicious Italian pasta dish is perfect for a quick and satisfying meal. Buon appetito!
